# 2024-SURP--Eyes-In-Motion-

Background:

It is estimated that around 7% of Americans have some form of mobility dissability. I want 
to support and push forward research meant to support them and open a new option for them to get the support
to live their life to the fullest.

I propose using eye-tracking to help wheelchair like navigation for individuals that may be unable to walk and 
are also unable to properly use existing wheelchair devices which rely on one's armstrength, arm movement/control,
and/or support from other peoples.
