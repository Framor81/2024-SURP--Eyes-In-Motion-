## Monday - 5/27

- Memorial Day

## Tuesday - 5/28

- I began reading documentation on RPC which stands for the Remote Procedure Call in order to be able to send and recieve commands between different python scripts.
    - As I read, I understood that the process of sending these commands may be too intensive, so I may have to come up with a better systemt hat allows for more information to be sent with a shorter latency.

- An issue that kept arising was that the camera kept turning on as denoted by the webcam light; however, the frames were not being displayed correctly instead just showing a completely gray screen.
    - This issue arose from the face detection and landmarks file. This is because I was feeding it the wrong path as I was specifying that we must enter the EyesInMotion folder when we were already inside of it. I made a small edit to this path and it ended up working.


- I then shifted focus to using pyautogui to control my mouse via the same python script with a while loop.
    - After reading documentation for a bit, I created a new file where I identified whether a user was blinking or not. If the user was blinking I would move the mouse to the left.
    - This confirms that the general idea is working, I will now refactor this code to work with gaze direction.


- I turned on the robot and had to reset up the date and time to get the wifi correctly working.
- I then installed python 3.6.9

## Wednesday - 5/29

- Goals for today: 
    - Make Eye tracking a bit more sensitive so I don't have to make such exaggerated movements.
    - Utilize the iris for eye tracking
    - Set up the robot to run a simple python script.
    - Get the motor and camera working on the robot by itself.

- Issues: This is calibrated towards my own eyes, and is less accurate on others.


- I played with some of the thresholds for defining what direction we are facing, and made it a bit more sensitive. Moreover, I go this working a bit better with controlling my mouse.
- I then transitioned to the robot and tried following the steps to try to get wifi working on the device.
- I read documentation on programming and getting a python script running on the device.


PS C:\Users\xmora> ssh -L 8001:localhost:8001 unreal
- I was able to get wifi working on the Jetson Nano.
