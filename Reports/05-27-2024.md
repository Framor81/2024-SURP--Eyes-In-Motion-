- I began reading documentation on RPC which stands for the Remote Procedure Call in order to be able to send and recieve commands between different python scripts.
    - As I read, I understood that the process of sending these commands may be too intensive, so I may have to come up with a better systemt hat allows for more information to be sent with a shorter latency.

- An issue that kept arising was that the camera kept turning on as denoted by the webcam light; however, the frames were not being displayed correctly instead just showing a completely gray screen.
    - This issue arose from the face detection and landmarks file. This is because I was feeding it the wrong path as I was specifying that we must enter the EyesInMotion folder when we were already inside of it. I made a small edit to this path and it ended up working.


- I then shifted focus to using pyautogui to control my mouse via the same python script with a while loop.
