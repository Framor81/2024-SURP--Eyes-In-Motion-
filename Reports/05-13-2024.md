## People of Interest

1. Disabilities in America: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html
    
    12.1% of individuals living in the United States have some form of mobility issues.

2. Cerebral Palsy: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/facts.html

    Cerebral Palsy is a type of disord that impacts an inviduals ability to move and mantain balance and posture. It is the most common motor disability in childhood. CP affects a person's ability to control his or her muscles caused by abnrormal brain development or damage to the developing brain.

    CP can vary from person to person but ranges from people not being able to walk whatsoever and needed lifelong care to midler cases where some individuals are still able to walk alebeit akwardly. CP may have problems with vision. One of the main CP that I will be focusing is Spastic Quadriplegia - the most sever form of Spastic CP and affects all four limbs, the trunk, and the face. People affliceted by it usually cannot walk and may have other developmental disabilities. 

    Next there exists Dyskinetic CP where people have problems controlling the movmetn of their hands arms, feet and legs, making it diffiuclt to sit and walk. Movements are hard, rapid, and jerky. Ataxic CP which leads to problem with coordination and balance and gives peolpe a harder time controlling their limbs.

    There is no cure for CP, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have the condition.

3. Spinal Cord Injuries: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/spinal-cord-injury

    Globally, over 15 million people are living with spinal cord injury. The term spinal cord injury (SCI) refers to damage to the spinal cord resulting from trauma or non-traumatic causes like tumors, degenerative and vascular conditions, infections, toxins or birth defects. It is associated with lower school enrolment and economic participation rates

     In paraplegia arm functions are not impacted; in tetraplegia or quadriplegia they are affected. This can decrease a person's ability to perform daily tasks like walking, using one's own hands, or other similar daily tasks. Barriers to mobility has restricted independence and their societal participation. 

     SCI tends to be a long term disability accounting for over 4.5 million years of life lived with disability.

     *Importantly, many restrictions in performing activities and participating in meaningful life areas do not result from the condition itself, but from insufficient or inadequate medical care, rehabilitation and assistive technologies access, a high economic burden, and from barriers in the physical, social and policy environments. For example, globally, only 5–35% have wheelchair access.*

     It is imperative that as SCI are a long-term disability that we provide adequate access to assistive products that eneable people to perform everyday activitities they otherwise couldn't to increase their independency and functioning.

4. SCI .gov : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560721/?report=printable 

    SCI occur when the axons of nerves running through the spinal cord are disrupted, leading to loss of motor and sensory function below the level of injury. Leading to varying degrees of sensory and motor function loss depending on the injury level and type. Common SCI patterns include complete transection, which causes total loss of motor and sensory functions below the injury level, and partial injuries like Central Cord and Brown-Séquard Syndromes, which affect different functions and sides of the body.

5. Quadriplegia: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?Db=mesh&Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=%22Quadriplegia%22%5BMeSH+Terms%5D 

    The locked-in syndrome is characterized by quadriplegia in combination with cranial muscle paralysis. Consciousness is spared and the only retained voluntary motor activity may be limited eye movements. This condition is usually caused by a lesion in the upper BRAIN STEM which injures the descending cortico-spinal and cortico-bulbar tracts.

## Eye Tracking

1. Eye Trackers and Suggestions when implementing them: https://www.boia.org/blog/creating-accessible-content-for-people-who-use-eye-tracking-devices Eye trackers typically uses a low-powered infrared light-emitting diode to illuminate the user's eye and a camera then tracks the reflections from the LED and software processes eye movements.By looking at specific parts of the screen, users can interact with on-screen keyboards, mouse simulators, and other input fields. The technology addresses many of the challenges that people with disabilities encounter

## Eye Tracking in Robotics

1. Evalutation of Tobii EyeX for Research: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13428-016-0762-9.pdf

    Tobii Claims that the system was conceived for natural eye gaze interaction and doesnt not require continoues recalibration allowing for moderate head movements. The SDK and toolkit allow for both biocular and monocular experiments and its performance is sufficient for measuring fixation parameters, saccadics, smooth pursuit and vergence eye movements. 

    However, it has relatively low sampling rate and moderate precision limit the suitability of monitoring micro-saccadic eye movements or for real-time gaze-contingent stimulus control.

2. Object Detection using Eye Tracking: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8716971 

    Eye tracking tehcnology provides a unique source of information about humans are abel to view the world. Eye tracking the intentaional view of an interested object and the intention free saccade will result in different eye movement measures which the person's intent can be inferred from.

    A user's inherent gaze offers location information which can be emplyed to locate the interested object in the scence to be recognized by the reasearchers.

    Tobii Eye Trackers 4C can only output low-level raw gaze recordings, such as 2D gaze positions and timestamps. Fixation length and fixation count are not provided in such low cost eye trackers.

    Proposing gaze-based interested ob ject detection approach using a low-cost ocnsumer-level remote eye tracker Developed framework to extract high-level eye movement merasurements from the raw gaze outputs of Tobii eye Tracker 4c with which the interested object can be detected.

    Their approach collecting gaze points and timestamps to construct gaze clusters and a vector machine classifiered to discriminate intentional gaze clusters from intention-free gaze clusters.

    Programmed in C++ for training-and-testing of these clusters. They then used their own equation to get a usersX-Y gaze coordinates on a screen at any instance in time to then construct a gaze point and place it in clusters based on certain thresholds being met (based on speed and length of gaze on specific places).

    They could then extra 3 features from these gaze clusters such as fixation length, radius of fixation and the number of time-adjacent clusters. These 3 features may help in detecting and differentiation intential gaze clusters to intention free ones.

    The performancre of detecting interested objects is then evaluated by overlaying the intentional gaze clusters with the corresponding image that the user has observed, the intentional objects can be detected. They are segmented together using a normalized cut. 

    They then highlighted the performance of a visual detection method where subjects trained with SVM tasks outperformed those who did not participate in SVM training. Specifically, the correct detection rate of intentional objects using this approach is high at 98.67%, but it also has a substantial fake detection rate of 41.73%, indicating a tendency to identify fake objects as targets. This compares favorably to a state-of-the-art method using a professional GP3 eye tracker, which has lower correct (72.3%) and fake detection rates (32.2%). This demonstrates that while the new approach is more effective at recognizing targets, it is also more prone to false positives. Howver, the low cost approach that this paper focuses on says that them it is not able to provide the pupil measurements that are informative about the visual intention of an individual and may lead to the hgiher rate of fake detection.

3. Current Robotics Exploration Using Eye-Tracking: https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ccl.idm.oclc.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9828061

    SCI patients are less free and thus a form of entertainment in the form of drones was proposed. It aimed to allow people with many disabilities who have limited mobility to still be able to have a sense of normality and freedom through drones.They accomplished this through an application that was able to recognize people's faces using a UV face mask that mapped the eyes based on other distinct landmarks on a person's face. It then is able to place extreme points for the eyes and a nromal computer vamera to decide where exactly one is looking at. So far, they have implement very simple commands like take off, land, and rotate.
